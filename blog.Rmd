### 2019-05-27: A Link Between Worlds

Next week, my fiance is leaving for Argentina for 6 weeks. Because of this, I was foolish enough to buy a new video game that I'm already absorbed into. Apparently I've only played bad Legend of Zelda games, as none of them have grabbed me before, but 'A Link Between Worlds' is phenomenal. As with most  Zelda games, it's an action RPG with lots of puzzles, but the game introduces a great new mechanic which literally adds another dimension to all of gameplay. Once you gain the ability to merge into walls (becoming 2D), you end up looking at every facet of the game (combat, puzzles, races, exploration) and wondering how it could be approached a different way, how could being 2D allow me to more effectively solve this problem. The transitions between 2D and 3D are also extremely fluid, not stopping the game cold like in Paper Mario. I'm already 1/4 of the way through after 2 days and will definitely be ordering another 3DS Zelda game to try out once I've finished.


### 2019-05-25: Thoughts on Lady Blackbird and Blogdown

Having now played [Lady Blackbird](http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/lady_blackbird.pdf) with my game group, I still can't quite wrap my head around its interesting skill/dice mechanic. A character in the game has 4 traits that describe something about the character (e.g. they're a detective, they're cunning, they're a country girl), and each trait then has a set of tags of characteristics related to that trait (e.g. a detective might be perceptive, have a gun, have authority). When the player meets a challenge, they say how they want to approach the challenge and the game master sets a challenge level (1-6), as the number of 4-6's that need to be rolled to to succeed. The more needed, the higher the difficulty.<br>
Following this, the player choose a trait that is relevant to the challenge (e.g. a cunning character could talk their way out of a fight), and any tags under that trait which could help. The number of tags is the number of dice you get to roll. After this, the players have a finite pool of dice that they can add to try and get enough to roll and succeed.<br>
So there's a strange negotiation that happens with every dice roll that you don't see in other games which kind of grinds the game to a halt. On top of that, the maths behind success rates become more counter intuitive as the number of 4-6's needed increases.

Ended up spending far more time that I should have working out the best strategies for dice rolls in the game.

I'd definitely play it again, as, despite it's simplicity, we probably spent more time discussing the weirdness of the games mechanics much more than with any other game.

I've also been playing around with swapping out this simple webpage with a much more advanced version in Blogdown, but for the life of me I've not been able to get it to work for anything. Maybe future Tom will have more luck, but for now I'm stuck with this thing. I've also heard Jekyll is worth it for a github page, but I'm enjoying doing everything in R at the moment and would rather not switch. Hopefully Boryana will be able to show me the right path to go down on Wednesday when she makes everything seem much simpler.

### 2019-05-24: Building a website

Testing out how to make a webpage in markdown using R. It's been suprisingly simple, though I've not experimented beyond a basic layout. May change it up and combine everything onto one page, as I don't have much to show at the moment. Hopefully Boryana will be able to show me how to spice it up.
