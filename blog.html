<p>I’ve submitted my K99 application finally and am free of this thing until it gets to review time.</p>
<p>Last night we played <a href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer-Quest-Blackstone-Fortress-2018-eng">BlackStone Fortress</a> again, and it’s a lot of fun, but far too complicated for what it is. Additionally, the characters are insanely unbalancing, with a few who get inspired (sort of leveling up) by finding an item and then become really powerful for every session for the rest of forever. Comparatively, some of the characters (namely the tank and healer) have fewer moves per turn, have less movement and need to get inspired again every session by killing a certain type of enemy. And if you don’t face that enemy ever then you’re screwed. In our sessions this has left us with 2 or 3 characters who began overpowered and have since accumulated so many items that they’re broken compared to the everyone else.<br> The game also uses variants of D6/D8/D12 with modified symbols for skills. Some skills come up more than others, so if your defense is a D12 compared to your agility, you’ll have a much better time than others.<br> Overall the game is fun though, looking forward to finishing it in the next week or so. Supposedly the fantasy version has simpler rules and is more streamlined, plus fantasy is more fun thank grim-dark so looking forward to testing out this other version.</p>

<p>While Dana is away, I’m also going to finally work through a couple of the Professor Layton games, puzzle games I’ve been wanting to play for close to ten years. Turns out I’m not very good at puzzle games. Even so, I managed to finish it last night and the story was some how both predictable and crazy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rob and I have put together a tool to detect copy variants in NGS data using machine-learning. Machine-learning is really cool, and super useful, basically letting the computer decide what can define a category is really powerful. Of course if you’re not using the right input information, you could end up inferring the completely wrong thing, so I’m still kind of iffy about it, but looking forward to using the tool to detect CNVs in AMPs. My initial survey looks like there’s a relationship between the variation in AMP copy number, and the average copy number. Worth expanding on this.</p>
<p>Finally, it turns out the real hero who died for our sins to save humanity is Mothra, with her sick new design and awesome song.</p>

<p>Having now tested out blogdown, I think I’m going to stick with basic R markdown for this site. Blogdown is incredibly powerful and has so many more options than basic markdown, but I just can’t wrap my head around a lot of it. Blogdown has a much steeper learning curve, and I can’t quite figure out what each section means. Like, why can I have a seperate page called ‘courses’ but not another name? If I add another page, or change its name, the website won’t compile or load.</p>
<p>This site looks a lot more basic than it would with blogdown, but I also wouldn’t be able to make this page as I can;t figure out how to have a blog not on the homepage. Again, maybe in the future I’ll get past the learning curve and remake this page in blogdown. Boryana’s guide was super useful and taught me a lot about website design and maintenance, as well as options in markdown and github, so glad I went over things with her.</p>

<p>Next week, my fiance is leaving for Argentina for 6 weeks. Because of this, I was foolish enough to buy a new video game that I’m already absorbed into. Apparently I’ve only played bad Legend of Zelda games, as none of them have grabbed me before, but ‘A Link Between Worlds’ is phenomenal. As with most Zelda games, it’s an action RPG with lots of puzzles, but the game introduces a great new mechanic which literally adds another dimension to all of gameplay. Once you gain the ability to merge into walls (becoming 2D), you end up looking at every facet of the game (combat, puzzles, races, exploration) and wondering how it could be approached a different way, how could being 2D allow me to more effectively solve this problem. The transitions between 2D and 3D are also extremely fluid, not stopping the game cold like in Paper Mario. I’m already 1/4 of the way through after 2 days and will definitely be ordering another 3DS Zelda game to try out once I’ve finished.</p>

<p>Having now played <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/lady_blackbird.pdf">Lady Blackbird</a> with my game group, I still can’t quite wrap my head around its interesting skill/dice mechanic. A character in the game has 4 traits that describe something about the character (e.g. they’re a detective, they’re cunning, they’re a country girl), and each trait then has a set of tags of characteristics related to that trait (e.g. a detective might be perceptive, have a gun, have authority). When the player meets a challenge, they say how they want to approach the challenge and the game master sets a challenge level (1-6), as the number of 4-6’s that need to be rolled to to succeed. The more needed, the higher the difficulty.<br> Following this, the player choose a trait that is relevant to the challenge (e.g. a cunning character could talk their way out of a fight), and any tags under that trait which could help. The number of tags is the number of dice you get to roll. After this, the players have a finite pool of dice that they can add to try and get enough to roll and succeed.<br> So there’s a strange negotiation that happens with every dice roll that you don’t see in other games which kind of grinds the game to a halt. On top of that, the maths behind success rates become more counter intuitive as the number of 4-6’s needed increases.</p>
<p><img src="posts/lbb_successrate.png" style="width:100%; margin-right: 20px"></p>
<p>Ended up spending far more time that I should have working out the best strategies for dice rolls in the game.</p>
<p>I’d definitely play it again, as, despite it’s simplicity, we probably spent more time discussing the weirdness of the games mechanics much more than with any other game.</p>
<p>I’ve also been playing around with swapping out this simple webpage with a much more advanced version in Blogdown, but for the life of me I’ve not been able to get it to work for anything. Maybe future Tom will have more luck, but for now I’m stuck with this thing. I’ve also heard Jekyll is worth it for a github page, but I’m enjoying doing everything in R at the moment and would rather not switch. Hopefully Boryana will be able to show me the right path to go down on Wednesday when she makes everything seem much simpler.</p>

<p>Testing out how to make a webpage in markdown using R. It’s been suprisingly simple, though I’ve not experimented beyond a basic layout. May change it up and combine everything onto one page, as I don’t have much to show at the moment. Hopefully Boryana will be able to show me how to spice it up.</p>
