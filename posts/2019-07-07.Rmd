#### Collections in Ithaca

For this past week I've been in Ithaca collecting *Drosophila* for the K99 I've submitted, as well as to escape the heat of Kansas, as Ithaca was maxed out at 25C, while Kansas has been around 30C. It was really fun to catch up with Ana and Ivan, really beautiful and kind of strange compared to Kansas, specifically I couldn't get over how hilly everywhere was and how close together everything is, I guess I've become a Kansan local. Either way, I ended up collecting close to 1000 flies (mostly dead, some alive), so was a successful trip.

However, my trip back has not been so successful. Just before my first flight back, a thunderstorm came over Ithaca, delaying us by 3 hours, after that mechanical errors held us back another hour, resulting in me missing my flight from DC to KC. After being moved to the next flight the next morning, it turned out that flight was cancelled and moved to *the next* day, which was then canceled completely like 20 minutes later. United couldn't get me a set of flights back in the next 2 days so I ended up switching to a different airline in a different airport, which let me see some of the sights around DC. I'm currently waiting in Atlanta and hopefully getting back late tonight and hopefully get to sleep on the planes.
